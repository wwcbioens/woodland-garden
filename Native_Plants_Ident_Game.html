  <p>INSTRUCTIONS</p>
  <p>Hopefully more will be added later on, for now I am just worrying
    about getting the first thing set up. So current instructions are
    more or less to follow the instructions as you go through the
    narrative - Pretend you are in these scenarios and make sure to
    pay attention to the garden around you! (Also so that it isn't
    seasonally dependent, some kind of brochure or info sheet that
    people could look at when the plants aren't out yet would be also
    handy to be able to tell them to reference here.)</p>
